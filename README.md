# Flags

I want to play a game to guess flags. Current games have at least one of these problems:
- They don't have support for the full 254 countries + sorveign states.
- They don't have autocomplete.
- They are multiple choice.
- They aren't made by me.

I have several plans to this game, such as to:

- Add a daily run of x (5-10) countries.
- Some kind of invite to competition, like guessing countries until the other part loses.
- Multiple choice option (I dislike it but I know some people like it).
- Category specific (only europe, only america, only europe & america, etc.).

### TODO
- +50 instead of set 50, then show amount.
- Make 'You Win' screen.
- separate countries by continent and let select by continents.
- Enable/Disable sorveign states.
- Dark Mode.
- Multiple choice mode.
- Make only the autocomplete tab-able in flagQuiz.
- Make try again and back to menu be tab-able before other buttons on 'you wi'n/'game over' popup.
- Make the 'submit' button more attention grabbing than the 'finish early' button

# Flags

I want to play a game to guess flags. Current games have at least one of these problems:
- They don't have support for the full 254 countries + sorveign states.
- They don't have autocomplete.
- They are multiple choice.
- They aren't made by me.

I have several plans to this game, such as to:

- Add a daily run of x (5-10) countries.
- Some kind of invite to competition, like guessing countries until the other part loses.
- Multiple choice option (I dislike it but I know some people like it).
- Category specific (only europe, only america, only europe & america, etc.).
